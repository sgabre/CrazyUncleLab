# System Software Architecture

This is a high-level structural view of your software.  
It explains how the system is layered or modularized, how responsibilities are divided, and how different components interact.

You should:

- Describe architectural layers (application, middleware, hardware abstraction)
- Highlight any design patterns or architectural principles used
- Explain how modules communicate (e.g., function calls, message queues)
- Mention cross-platform support (if modules are reused on PC or Python)

Purpose: Provide a conceptual blueprint of how the software is organized, and justify architectural decisions.
