# Hazard Mitigation

<< Define any necessary component segregation required to reduce the risks and how segregation is achieved.  
Describe also any other measure taken at architectural level to reduce or control the risks>>

In this section, you describe what architectural-level decisions were made to minimize or control safety risks.

Topics might include:

- Logical or physical segregation of critical components
- Use of watchdogs, assertions, or fault handlers
- Handling of invalid input or unexpected states
- Safe startup or shutdown sequences
- Restrictions on dynamic memory or threading (to reduce unpredictability)
- How SOUP is isolated or validated to prevent unexpected behavior

Purpose: Show how the design ensures safety, reliability, and robustness from the top down.
