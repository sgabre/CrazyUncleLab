## Key Algorithms 

This section identifies the core algorithms that the firmware implements â€” anything with significant logic or processing beyond basic I/O.

For each algorithm, you might provide:

- Its purpose and where it fits in the system
- A short description of how it works (detailed logic can go in detailed design docs)
- Information on input/output data or timing constraints
- Optionally, include a table or list format. The detailed code-level explanation would be referenced in another section or document.

Purpose: Highlight the most important logic your system runs and serve as a roadmap for deeper understanding or testing.
