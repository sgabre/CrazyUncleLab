# Software System Environment


This section provides an overview of the software tools, dependencies, and build environment required to develop, test, and run the system.

Include details such as:

- Programming language and coding standards (C, MISRA-C, C++)
- Development tools (IDE, compiler, debugger)
- Build system (e.g., CMake, Make, Docker containers)
- Operating systems (embedded RTOS or bare-metal, desktop platforms for simulation)
- External libraries or frameworks (HAL, unit testing frameworks, etc.)
- Documentation and version control tools (e.g., Doxygen, Git)

Purpose: Describe everything needed to build and maintain the software, and support traceability and reproducibility.
