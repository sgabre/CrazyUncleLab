## Hardware Architecture

This section describes the physical components of the system.  
It includes the microcontroller (e.g., STM32), power supply design, sensors, actuators, communication interfaces (USB, UART, CAN, etc.), and any peripherals connected to the MCU.

You should explain:

- What hardware is used (e.g., development board or custom PCB)
- How components are connected (bus types, GPIO usage, etc.)
- Key MCU peripherals (e.g., timers, ADCs, DMA) that your firmware relies on

Purpose: Help the reader understand the embedded platform the software will run on, and any physical or electrical constraints.
