## Interface Mechanisms

This section describes the **interface mechanisms** used for communication between different components in the system. These mechanisms define how data and control are exchanged.

- **Message Queues**: Used for inter-process communication (IPC) where components send messages asynchronously.
- **Example**: A message queue could be used by the sensor module to send sensor data to the application layer for processing.

- **Shared Memory**: A memory segment that multiple components access for data exchange, useful for high-performance applications.
- **Example**: A shared memory block could store sensor readings from the MCU's ADC, which are then processed by the software.

- **Function Calls (Direct)**: Direct calls between software modules (or between the module and its hardware abstraction layer).
- **Example**: The application layer might call the `Sensor_Read()` function to gather data from the sensor driver.

- **Interrupts**: Hardware interrupts trigger asynchronous events, typically used for time-sensitive tasks.
- **Example**: An interrupt could signal that a sensor's ADC conversion has completed, prompting the software to read the new data.

- **Events**: Used in real-time systems to indicate state changes or completion of tasks.
- **Example**: An event may signal that new sensor data is available for processing.

Each of these mechanisms is used for different purposes within the system, providing efficient and reliable communication between components.
