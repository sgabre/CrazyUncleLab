## Data Structures

This section defines the **data structures** used for interfacing between components, specifying data formats and any related structures.

- **Data Formats**: The format of data exchanged between components, such as JSON, binary, or raw sensor data.
- **Example**:
```c
typedef struct {
float temperature;
float humidity;
} SensorData_t;
```

- **Buffers and Queues**: Data structures like circular buffers or FIFO queues used to store and manage data flow.
- **Example**: A `SensorQueue_t` structure that holds a circular buffer for storing sensor data.

- **Control Structures**: Flags, semaphores, or other synchronization mechanisms used to coordinate the system's operation.
- **Example**: A structure used to track the status of sensor data acquisition.

- **Data Dictionary**: A detailed dictionary describing the data fields, valid ranges, and units of the data structures.
- **Example**: Refer to the "Data Dictionary" for an explanation of the `SensorData_t` structure and acceptable value ranges.

This section ensures that the data exchanged between components is well-defined and standardized for correct usage.
