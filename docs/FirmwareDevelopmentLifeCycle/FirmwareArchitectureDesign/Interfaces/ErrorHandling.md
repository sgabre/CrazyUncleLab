## Error Handling

In this section, we describe the **error handling mechanisms** employed in the system for handling errors in interface mechanisms and data exchanges.

- **Timeouts**: Used for interfaces like UART or SPI, where a failure to receive a response within a specified time is considered an error.
- **Example**: If UART communication times out, the system retries the transmission or flags an error.

- **Buffer Overflow or Underflow**: In message queues or circular buffers, the system must handle cases where buffers overflow (too many messages) or underflow (no data to read).
- **Example**: If a buffer overflows, the system could drop the oldest message or signal an error condition.

- **Checksum Errors**: Communication protocols like SPI or I2C may use checksums to ensure data integrity. If a checksum error occurs, the data is discarded or retried.
- **Example**: If a received message has a bad checksum, the system retries the communication.

- **Error Codes and Handling Structures**: A set of error codes or structures to track errors and respond appropriately.
- **Example**:
```c
typedef enum {
ERROR_UART_TIMEOUT,
ERROR_SENSOR_FAILURE,
ERROR_INVALID_DATA
} ErrorCode_t;
```

- **Fallback Strategies**: Mechanisms that ensure the system can recover or fail safely in the case of critical errors, like a sensor failure.
- **Example**: If a sensor fails, the system can revert to a default value or trigger an alert.

If error handling is described in another section (e.g., in the detailed design or testing documentation), you can reference that section here and avoid repetition.

This section ensures that the system can gracefully handle any errors that occur during communication or data exchange, maintaining reliability and robustness.
