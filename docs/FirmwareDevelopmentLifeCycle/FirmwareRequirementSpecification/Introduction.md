# Introduction

## Purpose & Scope

This document defines the firmware requirements for the system firmware **<<System firmware Reference>>**, which is used in the device **<<Device Reference>>**.

It is intended primarily for firmware engineers to define the **architecture** and **expected behavior** of the firmware system.  

Additionally, this document serves as the **authoritative source of requirements** against which the firmware will be verified and validated.

## Responsibilities

The **firmware development team** is responsible for the creation, maintenance, and version control of this document.

All other project team members — whether internal or external — are designated as **readers**.  

They may propose modifications through the defined change control process.
