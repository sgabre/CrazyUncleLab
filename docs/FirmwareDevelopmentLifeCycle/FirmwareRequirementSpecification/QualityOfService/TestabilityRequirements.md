# Testability Requirements

This section outlines the requirements for ensuring that the software system can be adequately tested throughout its lifecycle.

[REF-FRS-TST-0001] Shell 

The firmware shall include a **shell** for integration testing, allowing testers to interact with individual components or modules without needing to run the entire system. 

[REF N/A]  [STATUS ACTIVE] [REV 02]

**[REF-FRS-TST-0002] Shell - CLI**

The shell shall provide **command-line interface (CLI)** commands to initialize and configure modules for testing.

[REF N/A]  [STATUS ACTIVE] [REV 02]

**[REF-FRS-TST-0002] Shell - Setter/Getter**

The shell shall allow interaction with the firmware by **setting and getting internal states** of the components (e.g., configuration values, operational status).

[REF N/A]  [STATUS ACTIVE] [REV 02]

_[REF-FRS-TST-0002] Shell - Simulate Fault_

The shell shall allow testers to **simulate fault conditions**, such as erroneous data or communication failures, and test the system's response.

[REF N/A]  [STATUS ACTIVE] [REV 02]

_[REF-FRS-TST-0002] Shell - Logging_

The shell shall provide **logging** of interactions and test results for post-test analysis.

[REF N/A]  [STATUS ACTIVE] [REV 02]

_[REF-FRS-TST-0002] Shell - Portabl_

The shell shall be **portable** and compatible with different platforms (e.g., STM32, Raspberry Pi, Linux development environment) to facilitate integration testing on target hardware or during firmware development.

[REF N/A]  [STATUS ACTIVE] [REV 02]
