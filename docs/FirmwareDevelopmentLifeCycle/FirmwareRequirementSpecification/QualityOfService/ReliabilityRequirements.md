# Reliability Requirements


This section outlines the firmware reliability expectations necessary to ensure consistent and dependable system behavior throughout the deviceâ€™s lifecycle.

> - The firmware shall achieve a **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)** of at least **10,000 operating hours** under normal usage conditions.
> - The system shall detect and respond to firmware faults through **watchdog mechanisms**, **error handlers**, and **fail-safe states**.
> - Critical operations shall include **redundancy checks** (e.g., CRCs, checksums) to ensure data and execution integrity.
> - The firmware shall support **graceful degradation**: in case of partial failure, non-critical functions shall be disabled while maintaining essential safety-critical operations.
> - Persistent faults shall be **logged with timestamps and context information** for later analysis and root cause investigation.
> - The firmware shall support **automatic recovery** from transient errors without requiring user intervention.
> - Where applicable, **self-diagnostics** shall be performed at startup and periodically during runtime.
