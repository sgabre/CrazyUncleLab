# CrazyUncleLab — One-Page Summary (Open-Source Focus)

**Purpose:**  
CrazyUncleLab is a **meta-framework** to **accelerate development, testing, deployment, documentation, hardware, and mechanical workflows** using **only open-source tools**.  
It enforces **coding standards**, supports **cross-platform builds**, includes **dashboards**, and can serve as a **base for technical blog content**.

---

## Key Features

- **Framework Templates:** Firmware, software, mechanical projects; structured documentation (Project Charter, FRS, Test Plan).  
- **Coding Standards:** Enforced across all project types.  
- **Cross-Platform Development:** Shared libraries/services on **embedded targets + host machines**; CLI tools; log capture & parsing.  
- **DevBench Concept:** Minimal host (MacBook w/ Git + VS Code) using **open-source extensions**; heavy builds/tests handled by DevBench (Raspberry Pi/Mac Mini).  
- **CI/CD Automation:** GitHub Actions orchestrator; local runners; pipelines: **dev → test → production → device deployment**.  
- **Multi-Level Testing (ISTQB):** Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance, Non-functional; automated execution; hardware-in-the-loop.  
- **Docker & Environment Versioning:** Small reusable images (`fw-arm-builder`, `sw-linux-builder`, `code-quality`); cross-platform; full versioning (Version, Revision ID, Build Date, Compiler/Version).  
- **Documentation & Dashboards:** Auto-generation + manual editing (Doxygen, Sphinx, PlantUML); visualize project progress, builds, tests, hardware workflows.  
- **AI Assistance (Open-Source Tools):** AI-powered suggestions (e.g., Code Llama, GPT locally) for coding, refactoring, CI/CD scaffolding, documentation, diagrams, and blog content.  
- **Technical Blog:** Use CrazyUncleLab as content; AI assists in explanations, code snippets, diagrams, workflow examples.

## Scope

**In-Scope:**  
- Templates, coding standards, structured documentation (open-source formats)  
- CI/CD pipelines + DevBench runners  
- Docker images & reproducible builds (open-source tools only)  
- Automatic code/build synchronization  
- Multi-level testing (ISTQB)  
- Hardware workflows (flashing, 3D printing, CAD) using open-source tools  
- Dashboards & visualization  
- AI-assisted development using open-source AI tools  
- Technical blog generation  

**Out-of-Scope:**  
- Proprietary software/tools  
- Cloud deployment beyond GitHub (unless open-source CI runners)  
- Web dashboards for external analytics (proprietary services)
