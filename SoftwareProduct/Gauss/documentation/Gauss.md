P-iteration Method




($\vec{V_1}$, ) := P-iteration Function (, ,  )
Evaluate the constant , ,  from , and  using equation 5.4.4
Determine the limits on the value  by evaluating  and  from equation 5.4.14 and 5.4.15
Pick up a trial value of  within the appropriate limits
Using the trial value of , solve for  from equation 5.4.8 The conic type orbit will be know from the value of 
Solve  ,  and  from equation 5.2.3, 5.2.4 and 5.3.5
Solve   or , as appropriate, using equation 5.4.9 and 5.4.10 or 5.4.11
Solve  from equation 5.4.12 or 5.4.13 and compare it with the desired time-of-flight.
Adjust the trial value of  using one of the iteration methods discussed above until the desired time-of-flight is obtained.
Evaluate  from equation 5.2.6 and then solve  and  using equations 5 .2.7 and 5.2.2.


The p-iteration method converges in all cases except when   and  are collinear. Its main disadvantage is that separate equations are used for the ellipse and hyperbola. This defect may be overcome by using the universal variables X and z introduced in Chapter 4 and discussed earlier in this chapter.
