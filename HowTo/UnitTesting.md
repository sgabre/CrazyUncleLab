# What is a Unit Test in embedded Software ?


# What is the scope of a unit Test in embedded Software ?


# Why is the goal of Unit Test in embedded Software ?

The goal of the  Unit Tests is to Help Detect 

- Logic errors (incorrect algorithm implementation)
- Data handling errors (type conversion issues, incorrect data processing)
- Exception handling issues (poor error management)
- Unhandled edge cases (extreme values or special conditions)
- State inconsistencies (incorrect modifications to an object's state)
- Performance issues (if measured)
- API design flaws (incorrect input or output types)
- Regressions (previously fixed errors reappearing)
- Interaction issues with other components (e.g., database access problems)
- Missing or invalid values (invalid input or incorrect behavior with null values)

# Which technic can i use to write a Unit Test  ?

## Basic Level

- Equivalence partitioning testing
- Boundary testing
- State transition testing
- Use case testing
- Error testing

## Advance Level
- Exploratory Testing (Advance)
  * Architectural diagrams and use cases
  * Past defects
  * Error handling
  * Guesses
  * Discussions
- Error guessing (Advance)

# What are the Best Practices for Unit Testing ?

- Apply the 5W1H Approach (What, When, Where, Who, Why, How)
- Follow the FIRST Principles (Fast, Isolated, Repeatable, Self-validating, Timely)
- One Test = One Case (Keep Tests Simple and Focused)
- Follow the AAA Pattern (Arrange - Act - Assert)
- Use Mocks and Stubs to Isolate Components
