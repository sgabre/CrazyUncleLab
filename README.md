# CrazyUncleLab

**Purpose:**  

A **meta-framework** to accelerate **development, testing, deployment, documentation, hardware, and mechanical workflows** using **open-source tools**.

---

## Key Points

- **Templates & Standards:** Firmware, software, mechanical projects; structured documentation; enforced coding standards.  
- **Cross-Platform Dev:** Shared libraries/services on embedded targets + host; CLI tools; log parsing; DevBench for heavy builds/tests.  
- **CI/CD & Testing:** GitHub Actions orchestrator; local runners; pipelines: dev → test → production → device; multi-level ISTQB testing.  
- **Docker & Reproducibility:** Small reusable images; cross-platform; versioned environments (compiler, build date, revision).  
- **Documentation & Dashboards:** Auto-generated docs, diagrams; visualize project progress, builds, tests, hardware workflows.  
- **AI & Blog:** Open-source AI assists coding, CI/CD scaffolding, documentation, and technical blog generation.
